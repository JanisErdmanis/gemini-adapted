# Gemini Poster Theme Adaptation

Welcome to the adapted Gemini poster theme for Beamer. This design aims to provide a fresh and minimalist approach to posters by prioritizing typography and the appropriate spacing of visual elements.

## Features

- **Typography-Centric Design**: The focus is on typography and the efficient use of space, eliminating reliance on boxes to establish a hierarchy.
- **Readable Fonts**: This theme employs the *TEX Gyre Adventor* font for its clarity and readability and scaled *Computer Modern* font for formulas for expresiveness and emphasis. This pairs seamlessly with the *Helvetica* font often used in figures, ensuring a cohesive visual experience.
- **Easy Compilation**: This theme omits XeLaTeX font dependencies and can be compiled with LaTeX alone.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have LaTeX installed on your machine.
2. Download the Gemini poster theme files.
3. Compile using your preferred LaTeX compiler.

## Suggestions

For optimal results, consider using figures that utilize the *Helvetica* font, as this ensures a harmonious blend between text and visual elements.
